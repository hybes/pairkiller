## 📥 Installation

### Download
Get the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hybes/pairkiller/releases). Names follow the version tag, for example:

- **Windows**: `Pairkiller-Setup-<version>.exe` (NSIS installer — use this for Start Menu, uninstaller, and in-app updates)
- **macOS**: `Pairkiller-<version>-<arch>.dmg` or `.zip` (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: `.AppImage`, `.deb`, or `.tar.gz` for x64

### Platform-specific installation

#### Windows
1. Download **`Pairkiller-Setup-<version>.exe`** from [Releases](https://github.com/hybes/pairkiller/releases) (run the Setup wizard rather than a loose download-only `.exe`).
2. Install to the default location: **`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Pairkiller`** (per-user, no admin required).
3. You get **Desktop** and **Start Menu** shortcuts, a proper entry in **Settings → Apps → Installed apps**, and matching **taskbar** grouping.
4. Allow **Launch Pairkiller** at the end of the wizard if you want; auto-start at sign-in is still controlled from **Settings** inside the app.
5. The app runs from the system tray after install.

#### macOS
1. Download the **DMG** (or **ZIP**) for your architecture.
2. Open the DMG and drag Pairkiller into **Applications**.
3. Launch from Applications or Spotlight; grant permissions if macOS prompts you.

#### Linux
1. Download the **AppImage** (or **deb** / **tar.gz** if you prefer).
2. AppImage example: `chmod +x Pairkiller-*.AppImage` then `./Pairkiller-*.AppImage`

### Quick Start
1. Launch the application (it will start in the system tray)
2. Right-click the tray icon and select "Settings"
3. Choose a preset or create your own app group
4. Save and let Pairkiller manage your apps automatically!

## ⚙️ Platform Differences

### Process Detection
- **Windows**: Uses `tasklist` for process detection
- **macOS**: Uses `pgrep` and `ps` with fallback to AppleScript for .app bundles
- **Linux**: Uses `pgrep` and `ps` for process detection

### App Launching
- **Windows**: Direct executable launching
- **macOS**: Uses `open` command for .app bundles, direct execution for binaries
- **Linux**: Background process launching with `&`

### File Types
- **Windows**: Supports `.exe`, `.bat`, `.cmd` files
- **macOS**: Supports `.app` bundles and executables
- **Linux**: Supports all executable files

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.0 or newer
- Optional: ImageMagick if you generate multi-resolution icons locally

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hybes/pairkiller.git
cd pairkiller

bun install

bun run build:css
bun run dev
```

On **macOS**, packaged installs often use **menu-bar / tray-only** mode (no dock icon). **`bun run dev`** now forces the **Dock** visible and **opens Settings** automatically so you are not staring at an empty desktop. For a normal install, use the **tray icon** (top-right menu bar) → **Settings**.

### Building for distribution

**Quick commands:**
```bash
bun run build:icons     # Copy icon + regenerate trayTemplate.png (macOS) for menu bar
bun run build:mac       # macOS
bun run build:win       # Windows
bun run build:linux     # Linux
bun run build:all       # All platforms on current machine
bun run release         # Icons + all platforms
```

`build:win` only works on Windows (or a Windows VM), and `build:mac` only on macOS—electron-builder cannot cross-build the other OS reliably from one machine. For **both** artefacts in one release, use GitHub Actions (below) or build on two machines and upload the `dist/` outputs to the same [GitHub Release](https://github.com/hybes/pairkiller/releases).

### Shipping macOS + Windows (recommended)

**One workflow:** [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) runs on pushes to **`main`**, on **`v*`** tag pushes, and manually. It only **builds** when:

- you **bumped** the app **`version`** in [`package.json`](package.json) compared to the previous commit on **`main`**, or  
- the run was triggered by a **`v*`** tag, or  
- you used **Run workflow** (manual).

On a **version bump** push to `main`, it builds Mac + Windows and **[creates the GitHub Release and the `v…` tag](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release)** in the same run (no separate tag workflow). That avoids a GitHub limitation where a tag pushed with **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** does **not** start another workflow.

1. Bump **`version`**: **`nr version:patch`**, **`nr version:minor`**, or **`nr version:major`** (no local git tag — CI creates **`v…`**), or **`nr bump`** for [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) and the changelog. Commit and push **`main`**.
2. Open **Actions** → **Release** and wait for **gate** → **build** → **publish**.

**Manual tag:** `git tag v6.0.1 && git push origin v6.0.1` still triggers **Release** (tag push path).

**Manual run:** **Actions** → **Release** → **Run workflow**; the version you enter must match `package.json` on `main`.

**Auto-update (Windows):** the published release should include **`latest.yml`** and the **NSIS** **`.exe.blockmap`** files (uploaded by this workflow). Installed users update in place; the portable build is no longer shipped.

Local one-off builds:

```bash
bun run build:icons && bun run build:mac   # on a Mac → check dist/
bun run build:icons && bun run build:win   # on Windows → check dist/
```

### Platform-Specific Development

#### Windows Development
Requires Windows 10+ for full functionality testing.

#### macOS Development
Requires macOS 10.14+ and Xcode Command Line Tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Linux Development
Requires development packages:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Windows
**Q: Pairkiller isn't detecting my app**
A: Make sure you're using the correct process name (e.g., `notepad.exe`). Check Task Manager for the exact process name.

#### macOS
**Q: Can't detect Mac applications**
A: Try using just the app name without ".app" (e.g., "Steam" instead of "Steam.app"). For some apps, you may need to use the actual process name.

**Q: Permission denied when starting apps**
A: Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Automation and ensure Pairkiller has the necessary permissions.

#### Linux
**Q: AppImage won't run**
A: Ensure the file is executable (`chmod +x Pairkiller.AppImage`) and that you have FUSE installed.

### Common Issues

**Q: Controlled app isn't starting**
A: Verify the path to the executable is correct. Use the "Browse" button to select the file.

**Q: High CPU usage**
A: Increase the monitoring interval in settings to reduce frequency of checks.

### Debug mode
```bash
bun run dev
```

### In-app updates (installed builds)

- Pairkiller checks GitHub Releases in the background (packaged builds only) and notifies you when a newer version is available.
- Downloads are manual-confirm: you choose when to install. After a build is downloaded, you can use **Install & Restart** or simply **quit the app** — the pending update is applied on quit when possible.
- Development runs (`bun run dev`) skip automatic update checks to avoid noise.

### Windows install & uninstall

- **Installer**: NSIS **Setup** installs to **`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Pairkiller`**, creates shortcuts, and registers the app for **Apps & Features** (same fixed upgrade **GUID** across versions).
- **Legacy folders**: On install, the wizard only removes **other** folders that look like old installs (**`Pairkiller.exe` at the folder root**, e.g. a mistaken copy under Roaming or `Program Files`). Your normal **settings folder** is only data files (no `.exe` there) and is **not** deleted by the installer.
- **Auto-start** is set from **Settings** in the app; the installer does not force a Run key.
- **Uninstall**: **Settings → Apps** (or **Add or remove programs**) → **Pairkiller** → **Uninstall**. That removes program files and shortcuts; **`deleteAppDataOnUninstall`** is off, so your profile under **`%APPDATA%\pairkiller`** (Electron `userData` for this package name) is kept unless you remove it yourself.

### Logs
- **Windows**: config and app data under **`%APPDATA%\pairkiller`**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Pairkiller/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Pairkiller/logs/`
